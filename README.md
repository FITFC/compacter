# Compacter

This mods adds a single simple block - the Compacter.

* It will try crafting input items in either 2x2 or 3x3 pattern (configurable in the GUI) and output the result.
* It will process unlimited items per tick, as long as there enough items and energy provided.
* You can set it to work only when redstone signal is applied (configurable in the GUI).
* Recursive compacting mode can be enabled from the GUI which will try combining outputed items again (for e.g.
  compressed cobble).
* The compacter will use RF or EU power for every operation.
